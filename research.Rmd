### How are environmentally sensitive endocrine signals integrated into color pattern development? 
Most phenotypes are shaped by both genetic and environmental factors. Over time, predictable environmental cues can be leveraged by natural selection to tailor phenotypes to have higher fitness under different conditions. These cues are converted into internal signals, which are then integrated into developmental networks. In the common buckeye butterfly, Junonia coenia, seasonal temperature and photoperiod cues initiate ecdysone signals that are integrated into color and patterning networks. I am currently conducting an RNA-seq time-series experiment to better understand how endocrine signaling changes gene expression throughout wing color pattern development.

### How do mechanisms of seasonal phenotypic plasticity evolve across populations? 
The evolution of phenotypic plasticity has been the topic of debate since Conrad Waddington’s seminal work demonstrating canalization of plastic phenotypes in fruit flies. It hasn’t been until recently that scientists have begun dissecting the genes that lead to such changes, particularly in natural populations. Buckeye butterflies vary in the degree of their plasticity across populations, and I am using genome wide association studies (GWAS), RNA-seeq, and CRISPR/Cas9 mosaic knockouts to map and validate loci that underlie variation in plasticity across two populations in the United States.

### How are conserved signaling pathways deployed during eyespot development? 
Throughout the animal kingdom, signaling pathways play conserved roles in embryonic development. These same pathways have evolved to be deployed later in development to form derived characters. One classic example of this are butterfly wing patterns, which evolved from simpler monochromatic millions of years ago. Wing, leg, and antennal gene regulatory networks have all potentially been coopted in this process, utilizing Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, and TGF-beta signaling pathways. Eyespots are a unique pattern that has conversantly evolved multiple times across lepidoptera, and are generally assumed to form through morphogen signaling out of the focus. What that morphogen is and how surrounding cells respond to it is still under heavy research. I am investigating the role of a putative receptor in the development of eyespots using comparative transcriptomics, antibody staining, and CRISPR/Cas9 mosaic knockouts.
