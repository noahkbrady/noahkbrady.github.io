I am a PhD candidate at Cornell University, where I study evolutionary developmental biology. I’m passionate about using data from disparate sources and disciplines to expand our understanding of biological processes. My research combines genetic mapping with epigenetics, transcriptomics, and functional-genetics to describe the developmental and evolutionary mechanisms that produce morphological diversity in insects.

I am the fortunate recipient of opportunities that allow me to pursue a career that I’m passionate about, and I believe that everybody should have these same opportunities. I’m committed to using the position I’m in to promote equity within the natural sciences, which led me to serve as a co-leader for Cornell Diversity Preview Weekend (now Consider Cornell) for three years. In this position, I worked alongside many talented graduate students to organize annual events designed to lower the barrier of entry into graduate school for students from underrepresented backgrounds. In addition to this work, I helped secure institutional support for Cornell Diversity Preview Weekend and served on my department’s diversity, equity, and inclusion committee to promote equitable hiring practices. 

When not in the lab, I enjoy tennis, hiking, running, gardening, photography, and cooking… many traits of your typical EEB grad student. Please reach out if you would like to talk about my research or have any questions about the methods I use!

## Current Research
Why do traits vary across environmental conditions? The answer we can give with the most certainty, that traits vary across environments due to the contributions of local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity, is an oversimplification. The answer can expand in both ultimate and proximate directions: traits vary across environments because of their evolutionary history and because of how they incorporate the environment into their development. Because the particular state of a trait (for example, the color of a butterfly's wing) is a composite of the environmental context that it developed in and the evolutionary context that shaped its genome, answering these questions requires understanding the interplay of the genetic and environmental basis of a trait as mediated by development. Understanding how environmental signals change development, and how these changes become adaptive is a primary objective in the field of evolutionary developmental biology. But more broadly this question underpins the effort to map genotypes to phenotypes, to understand the elaboration of complex traits, and to describe how traits mediate interactions with the environment. 

In my PhD, I study how developmental systems integrate environmental information and how the processes that serve this function evolve. My research falls under three projects, all conducted in the common buckeye butterfly (Junonia coenia): 1) the surprising transcriptional and epigenetic plasticity of an environmentally insensitive trait; 2) the mechanistic response of tissues to environmentally-cued endocrine signals; and 3) the genetic architecture of regional variation in developmental plasticity. Together, these projects use an integrated approach to expand our understanding of the ultimate and proximate causes of trait diversity in animals.

### Evolution of Transcriptional and Epigenetic Plasticity
Phenotypic plasticity generates biodiversity and could modulate the evolution of new species. To validate theoretical predictions of the role of plasticity in evolution, we must understand the mechanism by which the plasticity of traits evolve. In this project, we quantified gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the developing wings of J. coenia butterflies from two populations that differ in their degree of wing color plasticity. We found a surprising amount of cryptic transcriptional and epigenetic plasticity in the population that is environmentally inflexible alongside relatively little plasticity in these same metrics in the phenotypically plastic population. Our findings highlight the critical role that epigenetic changes to chromatin accessibility play in the regulation of plastic gene expression and show that the extent of plasticity in these processes need not mirror the plasticity of traits.

### Mechansisms of Sensitivity to Environmentally-cued Endocrine Signals 
In most non-model insects, our understanding of how environmental stimuli change development is limited, but often involves the induction of endocrine signals that regulate downstream developmental pathways. In order to formulate hypotheses about how plasticity evolves, we must first understand how environmentally-sensitive endocrine signals change development. In J. coenia, seasonal changes in temperature and photoperiod alter the presence of the molting hormone ecdysone during a period of pupal development critical to color pattern formation: in the summer, the presence of ecdysone leads to the development of tan wings and small eyespots, while in the fall, the absence of ecdysone leads to the development of red wings and large eyespots. My first project combines transcriptomics and chromatin profiling with ecdysone manipulations throughout development to describe how tissues respond to this environmentally-cued endocrine signal.

### Genetic Architecture of Regional Variation in Plasticity 
How does selection act on plastic traits? A growing body of research shows that the degree of plasticity of a trait (whether a trait changes its state dramatically between environmental conditions or just a little) is evolutionarily labile, but how a trait that relies on an environmental signal can become locally adapted is unknown. The degree of seasonal wing color plasticity varies between populations of buckeye butterflies. I’m currently using genetic mapping, transcriptomics, and CRISPR-cas9 to interrogate the genetic basis of this variation.
