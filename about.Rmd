I’m an evolutionary biologist currently getting my PhD at Cornell University. I love all kinds of integrative biology, the type of research that uses data from a wide range of sources to tell stories about interesting natural history phenomena. I study how butterflies evolved the ability to convert seasonal environmental signals into adaptive changes in color patterns: i.e. the evolution of adaptive developmental plasticity. This research has taken me from the field to the bench, where I use a broad range of genomic, epigenetic, and functional methods to thoroughly describe these processes. When not in the lab, I enjoy hiking, snowshoeing, gardening, photography, and cooking… so basically your typical EEB grad student. Please reach out if you would like to talk about my research or have any questions about the methods I use!
