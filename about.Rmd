I am an evolutionary biologist with an interest in the genetics underlying complex traits in ants. I started my graduate studies in August 2019, in the lab of [Dr. Corrie Moreau](http://www.moreaulab.entomology.cornell.edu/people/corrie-moreau/) in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. I'm currently investigating patterns of molecular evolution associated with different manifestations of phenotypic plasticity in ants. 

If Iâ€™m not running analyses and writing scripts, I might be found [thinking about, and working toward,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CmyBVG3H-OBqUIomPKoBPwLVUdLC1WWtvhH836ZeJ7o/edit?usp=sharing) making ecology and evolutionary biology a better, more anti-racist space through my departmental roles as a graduate student, member of Cornell EEB Seminar series committee, and Cornell EEB Graduate Student Association co-president. 

I also enjoy hiking, nature photography, [creating art](art.html), and cooking.
