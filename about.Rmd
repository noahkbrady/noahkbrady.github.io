I am a biologist. Its difficult for me to pin my research interests more specifically, but I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University, so I'll narrow it down to this: I am interested in how forms in nature arise. I was in our insect collection the other day, and I pulled out a drawer of butterflies with transluscent windows on their wings. These aren't artifacts of the specimens being old, they formed naturally during the animals development, and, more ultimately, they formed over millions of years, through natural selection, to have these unique, beautiful, functional adaptations. It is the combination of the proximate (development) and ultimate (evolution) causes of phenotypic variation that drive my research. I don't actually study butterflies with clear wings, I study those with big eyespots and other colorful patterns, and I use labratory and computational methods to tease out how these patterns arise. 

Other than that, as with most people in my discipline, I love to explore nature. I also like to take pictures of nature, especially really close up ones that let you see things from a different perspective. In the same vein, I like to write about science and nature, and I hope to add some casual essays to this website in the future.
