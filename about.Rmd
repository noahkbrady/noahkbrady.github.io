I am an evolutionary biologist with an interest in the genetics underlying complex traits in ants. I started my graduate studies in August 2019, in the lab of [Dr. Corrie Moreau](http://www.moreaulab.entomology.cornell.edu/people/corrie-moreau/) in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University. I'm currently investigating patterns of molecular evolution associated with different manifestations of phenotypic plasticity in ants. 

If I’m not running analyses and writing scripts, I might be found [thinking about, and working toward,](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CmyBVG3H-OBqUIomPKoBPwLVUdLC1WWtvhH836ZeJ7o/edit?usp=sharing) making ecology and evolutionary biology a better, more anti-racist space through my departmental roles as a graduate student, member of Cornell EEB Seminar series committee, and Cornell EEB Graduate Student Association co-president. 

I also enjoy hiking, nature photography, [creating art](art.html), and cooking.
