I am a PhD candidate at Cornell University, where I study evolutionary developmental biology. I’m passionate about using data from disparate sources and disciplines to expand our understanding of biological processes. My research combines genetic mapping with epigenetics, transcriptomics, and functional-genetics to describe the developmental and evolutionary mechanisms that produce morphological diversity.

I am the fortunate recipient of opportunities that allow me to pursue a career that I’m passionate about, and I believe that everybody should have these same opportunities. I’m committed to using my position to promote equity within the natural sciences, which led me to serve as a co-leader for Cornell Diversity Preview Weekend (now Consider Cornell) for three years. In this position, I worked alongside many talented graduate students to organize annual events designed to lower the barrier of entry into graduate school for students from underrepresented backgrounds. In addition to this work, I helped secure institutional support for Cornell Diversity Preview Weekend and served on my department’s diversity, equity, and inclusion committee to promote equitable hiring practices. 

When not in the lab, I enjoy tennis, hiking, running, gardening, photography, and cooking. Please reach out if you would like to talk about my research or have any questions about the methods I use!

## Current Research
Many traits vary across heterogeneous environments. The cause of this variation stems from the combination of a trait's evolutionary history and the extent to which its development integrates - or is robust to - environmental information. Because the particular state of a trait is a composite of the environmental context that it developed in and the evolutionary context that shaped its genome, answering these questions requires understanding the interplay of the genetic and environmental basis of a trait as mediated by development. Understanding how environmental signals change development is a primary objective in the field of evolutionary developmental biology. More broadly, this question underpins efforts to map genotypes to phenotypes and to understand the origin and elaboration of complex traits.

I study how developmental systems integrate environmental information and how the processes that serve this function evolve. My research falls under three projects, all conducted in the common buckeye butterfly (Junonia coenia): 1) the surprising transcriptional and epigenetic plasticity of an environmentally insensitive trait; 2) the mechanistic response of tissues to environmentally-cued endocrine signals; and 3) the genetic architecture of regional variation in developmental plasticity. Together, these projects use an integrated approach to expand our understanding of the ultimate and proximate causes of trait diversity.

### Evolution of Transcriptional and Epigenetic Plasticity
Phenotypic plasticity generates biodiversity and could modulate the evolution of new species. To validate theoretical predictions of the role of plasticity in evolution, we must understand the mechanism by which the plasticity of traits evolve. In this project, we quantified gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the developing wings of J. coenia butterflies from two populations that differ in their degree of wing color plasticity. We found a surprising amount of cryptic transcriptional and epigenetic plasticity in the population that is environmentally inflexible alongside relatively little plasticity in these same metrics in the phenotypically plastic population. Our findings highlight the critical role that epigenetic changes to chromatin accessibility play in the regulation of plastic gene expression and show that the extent of plasticity in these processes need not mirror the plasticity of traits.

### Mechansisms of Sensitivity to Environmentally-cued Endocrine Signals 
The external environment is an omnipresent force that shapes organismal development. Organisms respond to environmental stimuli along a continuum from robust to plastic, and the result of this response significantly alters the morphological and fitness outcomes of development. Processing environmental information is therefore a critical component of developmental systems. Utilizing the aforementioned system of wing plasticity in J. coenia, we combine experimental manipulations of hormones in ex-situ tissue culture with measures of gene expression and chromatin accessibility across development to test hypotheses about the mechanisms that modulate the plasticity of developmental systems. These data allow us to make critical links between ecdysone signals, downstream transducers, and the activity of trait-specific developmental programs.

### Genetic Architecture of Regional Variation in Plasticity 
Using a combination of GWAS and genome wide Fst scans, I identified loci that are associated with variation in the degree of plasticity in two distinct traits on butterlfy wings. Then, using in-situ hybridization and CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockouts, I tested the developmental function of these genes. The results illustrate that the genetic architecture of these two traits, despite having coordinated responses to the same environmental cue, is distinct. My research implies that the genetic variation that underlies variation in plasticity can exist in regions that control the sensitivity to mechanisms that transduce environmental cues, which would allow these traits to evolve tailored responses to the environment without sacrificing their capacity for future adaptation.
